# Connecting a coding agent to Kiln

How to hand the work-order loop and the survey surface to Claude Code (or any
MCP client that speaks streamable HTTP). This is the Phase-1 loop:
`list_ready_work_orders` → `get_work_order` → implement → `update_work_order_status`.
Three further tools (§4) are the survey surface: `get_project_shape` (the
read-only populated-project pre-flight) plus `propose_feature` and
`propose_root_overview` — the ONLY document writes that exist over MCP, and
both are gated: proposals land as pending suggestions a human resolves in the
app.

There are two ways to serve these tools, and they run the **same bridge** —
same tools, same bearer auth, same context receipts:

- **The bundled endpoint (recommended).** The installed desktop app hosts the
  MCP server itself, behind a Settings toggle. No repo, no package manager, no
  terminal. This is §1 and the default for everyone who downloaded the app.
- **The standalone server (headless / CI).** Run `packages/mcp-server` from a
  repo checkout with hand-set environment variables. This is for headless and
  CI contexts where there is no app; see [§6 Headless / CI](#6-headless--ci).

## 1. Enable agent access in the app

In the desktop app, open **Settings → Agent access** and turn the toggle on.
Enabling it:

- generates a bearer token (a locally-minted credential for a localhost
  endpoint — shown in full because its whole purpose is being pasted into an
  agent config),
- binds the MCP endpoint to a localhost port (default `4824`; editable, and a
  bind conflict surfaces as a loud status, never a silent fallback),
- **pins the currently-active project** — the endpoint serves that project for
  as long as it stays on, and the status line names it.

The status line reports running/stopped, the port, and the served project.
Toggle state, port, and token persist across app restarts; quitting the app
stops the endpoint and relaunching with the toggle on restores it with the
same token and port.

### Which project does the endpoint serve?

The endpoint serves a **dedicated store on the project that was active when you
enabled it** — the pinned project, named in the status line. This is the
no-yank guarantee: **switching the app's active project does NOT move what a
connected agent sees.** An agent mid-work-order stays on the project it started
with, by design.

Re-pointing the endpoint at another project is an **explicit action**: when the
app's active project differs from the pinned one, Settings shows a re-pin
control naming both; clicking it closes the pinned store, opens the newly-active
one, and restarts the listener with the same token and port. Removing the
pinned project from the registry disables agent access loudly (the status names
the reason).

## 2. Register with Claude Code

Settings renders a ready-to-paste registration snippet, filled in with the live
URL and token — **Claude Code first**, then a generic JSON config block, each
with a copy button. Copy the Claude Code command and run it:

```sh
claude mcp add --transport http kiln http://127.0.0.1:4824/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <the token shown in Settings>"
```

Verify the connection (this performs a real MCP handshake):

```sh
claude mcp list
# kiln: http://127.0.0.1:4824/mcp (HTTP) - ✔ Connected
```

Then start `claude` in your project. The six tools appear as
`mcp__kiln__list_ready_work_orders`, `mcp__kiln__get_work_order`,
`mcp__kiln__update_work_order_status`, `mcp__kiln__get_project_shape`,
`mcp__kiln__propose_feature`, and `mcp__kiln__propose_root_overview`.

Regenerating the token in Settings mints a fresh credential and invalidates the
old one immediately — re-run `claude mcp add` (or re-paste the updated snippet)
after regenerating.

**Other MCP clients** — the generic JSON block Settings renders is the
`mcpServers` shape (`.mcp.json` / `claude_desktop_config.json`); any client that
speaks streamable HTTP works the same way: point it at the URL and supply the
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. With the TypeScript SDK:

```ts
import { Client } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index.js";
import { StreamableHTTPClientTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/streamableHttp.js";

const client = new Client({ name: "my-agent", version: "0.0.0" });
await client.connect(
  new StreamableHTTPClientTransport(new URL("http://127.0.0.1:4824/mcp"), {
    requestInit: { headers: { authorization: "Bearer <the token shown in Settings>" } },
  }),
);
```

Every request without a valid `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header is refused
with `401` before it reaches any tool.

## 3. Run the loop

Ask the agent to work the board, or call the tools directly:

1. **`list_ready_work_orders`** → `{ workOrders: [{ id, title, summary }] }` —
   every work order that is `ready` **and unblocked**: a work order with any
   `depends_on` target not yet `done` is withheld even if its own status is
   `ready`, so an agent is never handed work whose groundwork is unfinished.
2. **`get_work_order { id }`** → the full assembled context:
   `{ workOrder, workType, guidance, blueprint, requirement, artifacts,
   dependencies, lineage }` — the complete
   `work_order → blueprint → requirement → artifact` chain in one
   call. Missing links come back as `null`/`[]`, never as errors. The payload
   fields:

   | Field | Shape | What it is |
   |---|---|---|
   | `workOrder` | entity | The unit of work. |
   | `workType` | `feature \| bug \| refactor \| perf \| chore` | The order's effective work type (unset resolves to `feature`). |
   | `guidance` | string | **Per-type execution discipline — tier-1, follow it while implementing** (e.g. bug → reproduce first and keep a regression test; refactor → no behavior change; perf → measure before/after and cite numbers in the report). Deterministic: derived purely from `workType`, never model-generated. |
   | `blueprint` | entity \| null | The blueprint it implements. |
   | `requirement` | entity \| null | The requirement that blueprint details. |
   | `artifacts` | entity[] | Artifacts the requirement references directly. |
   | `dependencies` | `{ id, title, status }[]` | Its `depends_on` targets. If you were offered this order, they are all `done`. |
   | `lineage` | `{ requirement, artifacts, blueprint? }[]` | **Inherited intent** — ancestor requirements up the `child_of` chain (nearest first), each with the artifacts it references. An artifact referenced at multiple levels appears once, at the nearest. `[]` for a top-level requirement. This is how a deeply-nested work order still sees root-level intent (a kickoff transcript or PRD referenced high in the tree) without the child re-referencing it. `blueprint` (Phase 14) is that ancestor's `details` blueprint when one exists — absent otherwise. In a store with a product root, the LAST lineage entry is the product itself: its body is the Product Overview and its `blueprint` the system architecture. Read tier-wise: nearest entries are situational context; the root entry is BACKGROUND — skim it, never let it override the work order (see the kiln-execute skill's reading order). |
3. Implement the work.
4. **`update_work_order_status { id, status, report? }`** — allowed transitions
   are `draft→ready`, `ready→in_progress`, `in_progress→done`, and
   `any→cancelled`. Anything else is rejected with a message listing the
   allowed next states, e.g.:

   ```
   Invalid status transition ready → done. Allowed from ready: in_progress, cancelled.
   ```

   So the agent marks the order `in_progress` when it starts and `done` when it
   finishes.

   **Closing `in_progress → done` REQUIRES a completion report** — the return
   half of the handoff loop. The context receipt recorded at `get_work_order`
   says what Kiln handed the agent; the completion receipt says what came
   back, as an immutable, append-only record tied to the work order. The
   `report` fields:

   | Field | Shape | Required | What it is |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | `summary` | string | yes — non-blank | What was built. |
   | `verification` | string | yes — non-blank | How it was proven, with real output (test results, live checks). |
   | `commits` | string[] | no (defaults to `[]`) | Testimony: the commits carrying the work. Recorded as given, never verified against a repository. |
   | `branch` | string | no | Testimony: the branch the work landed on. |
   | `filesTouched` | string[] | no (defaults to `[]`) | Testimony: the files changed. |

   The receipt is written atomically with the transition — both happen or
   neither does — and the receipt's id comes back in the result. Output shape:
   `{ workOrder, completionReceiptId? }`, where `completionReceiptId` is
   present exactly when a report was recorded (i.e. on `in_progress → done`).
   A compliant close:

   ```json
   {
     "id": "3f6d21aa-…",
     "status": "done",
     "report": {
       "summary": "Added the `completed` event kind to the Pulse activity timeline, sourced from completion receipts.",
       "verification": "pnpm -C packages/core test — all suites pass, incl. 4 new cases in pulse.test.ts; live: closed a WO over MCP and saw the completed event on the Pulse feed.",
       "commits": ["a1b2c3d Surface completed handoffs in Pulse"],
       "branch": "main",
       "filesTouched": ["packages/core/src/graph/pulse.ts", "packages/core/src/graph/pulse.test.ts"]
     }
   }
   ```

   The failure modes are loud, and none of them changes the status or records
   a receipt:

   - **`done` without a report:**

     ```
     Closing in_progress → done requires a completion report. Missing: report.summary (what was built) and report.verification (how it was proven, with real output). Optional testimony: report.commits, report.branch, report.filesTouched. The status is unchanged.
     ```

   - **A report on any other transition** (it travels only on the close):

     ```
     A completion report is only accepted when closing in_progress → done; this is ready → in_progress. No receipt was recorded and the status is unchanged.
     ```

   - **A blank field** — empty and whitespace-only `summary`/`verification`
     are rejected (values are stored verbatim, never trimmed):

     ```
     Invalid completion report — no receipt recorded, status unchanged: report.summary: summary must not be empty or whitespace-only
     ```

## 4. The survey surface — pre-flight and gated document writes

`get_project_shape`, `propose_feature`, and `propose_root_overview` exist for
**survey agents** bootstrapping a brownfield repository into a fresh Kiln
project (the procedure lives in
[`skills/kiln-survey/SKILL.md`](../skills/kiln-survey/SKILL.md)). The propose
tools are the only document-write paths over MCP, and both are deliberately
**gated**: there are no ungated document writes. The invariant, precisely:

> Document writes over MCP exist ONLY as gated proposals via
> `propose_feature` and `propose_root_overview` — the proposed bodies land
> as pending suggestions a human accepts or rejects in the app; nothing is
> committed by either call. Execution agents (the kiln-execute loop) still
> never author documents.

### `get_project_shape` — the populated-project pre-flight

Read-only, no input, records nothing (a shape read is not a context handoff —
no receipt). It answers the one question a surveyor must settle before
proposing anything: *is this project safe to survey into?* Before this tool
existed, `list_ready_work_orders` was the only signal, and a populated
project with no ready work orders was indistinguishable from a fresh one.
Output:

| Field | Shape | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `shape` | `empty \| fresh \| populated` | `empty`: no entities at all — the store was never seeded, so the propose tools will fail for want of a product root. `fresh`: exactly the seeded pair — one parentless requirement with an empty body, its one `details` blueprint still empty or the seeded fill-in template, nothing else, no pending suggestions — safe to survey into. `populated`: anything else — someone (human or prior survey) already owns part of the graph; v1 does not merge. |
| `rootTitle` | string \| null | The single parentless requirement's title (confirm it matches the project the human named); `null` when there are none or several. |
| `counts` | `{ requirements, blueprints, workOrders, artifacts }` | Entity counts by type — the evidence behind the classification, worth reporting when warning about a populated target. |
| `pendingSuggestions` | number | Pending suggestions across all entities. Any pending suggestion makes the project non-fresh: proposals already await review. |

The classification is authoritative for the *store's contents*; it cannot
tell you whether the bound store is the one the human *intended* — pair it
with the `rootTitle` check and the served-project name in Settings (§1).

### `propose_feature` — one feature per call

One call proposes ONE feature. Input:

| Field | Shape | Required | What it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `requirement` | `{ title, body }` | yes | The feature requirement, per the house template (Capability / Why / Scope / Non-goals / Success criteria). |
| `blueprint` | `{ title, body }` | yes | Its blueprint, per the house template (Approach / Key decisions / Affected components / Conventions & constraints / Verification strategy). |
| `evidence` | `{ title, body }[]` | yes — 1 to 20 | Evidence artifacts: repo-relative file paths, verbatim excerpts, and the surveyor's rationale. |
| `parentRequirementId` | string | no | Parent for `child_of`. Omit for a feature directly under the product root — the single parentless requirement is resolved automatically. |

A successful call creates, atomically (a mid-write failure compensates by
deleting everything it created):

- the requirement and blueprint as **empty-bodied** entities, linked
  `child_of` → parent and `details` → requirement;
- the proposed bodies as one **pending suggestion** per document — the gate;
- the evidence artifacts with their bodies committed directly (read-only
  source material), each `references`-linked from the requirement so context
  assembly delivers the evidence to future work orders.

Output shape: `{ requirementId, blueprintId, artifactIds, suggestionIds }`,
where `suggestionIds` is `[requirement suggestion, blueprint suggestion]`.
A compliant call:

```json
{
  "requirement": {
    "title": "Keto logging over MCP — log meals and meter readings from Claude",
    "body": "## Capability\nA user logs food and readings from Claude…\n\n## Why\n…\n\n## Scope\n- Nine MCP tools registered on the Worker…\n\n## Non-goals\n- No food recognition on the server…\n\n## Success criteria\n- Calling log_food creates an entry visible in the web timeline…"
  },
  "blueprint": {
    "title": "BP — MCP keto logging tools on the Worker",
    "body": "## Approach\nEach tool is a module in mcp/tools/ registered by registerTools()…\n\n## Key decisions\n- **One Worker for app + MCP** — …\n\n## Affected components\n…\n\n## Conventions & constraints\n…\n\n## Verification strategy\n…"
  },
  "evidence": [
    {
      "title": "Survey evidence: MCP keto logging (mcp/register-tools.ts, README.md)",
      "body": "**mcp/register-tools.ts** — nine tools registered centrally:\n```ts\nawait registerLogFoodTool(agent)\n…\n```\nRationale: the tool registry and README framing evidence a deliberate capability."
    }
  ]
}
```

Proposals must be **born compliant** — every rejection happens at the tool
boundary, names the offending document and check, and creates nothing. The
validation failures are collected and returned together:

```
Proposal rejected — nothing was created:
- evidence: at least one evidence artifact is required — a proposal without evidence is an invention
- requirement: no Non-goals section (missing-non-goals) — every feature has adjacent scope it should decline
- requirement: feature title must follow `<Name> — <plain-language description>` (feature-title-shape)
```

The full rejection catalog:

| Rejection | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `<doc>: title is empty or whitespace-only` | Blank title on `requirement`, `blueprint`, or `evidence[i]`. |
| `<doc>: title exceeds 200 characters (N)` | Title over the cap. |
| `<doc>: body is empty or whitespace-only (empty-body)` | Blank body. |
| `<doc>: body exceeds 20000 characters (N)` | Body over the cap. |
| `evidence: at least one evidence artifact is required — a proposal without evidence is an invention` | `evidence: []`. |
| `evidence: N artifacts exceed the cap of 20` | Too many evidence artifacts. |
| `requirement: no Non-goals section (missing-non-goals) — …` | The health check: the requirement body has no `Non-goals` heading (any `#` level) — the same canonical-heading test `documentHealth` uses. |
| ``requirement: feature title must follow `<Name> — <plain-language description>` (feature-title-shape)`` | Applies only when the parent is the product root: the title needs name, space, em-dash (—), space, description. |
| `Parent requirement not found: <id>` | Explicit `parentRequirementId` doesn't exist. |
| `Proposal parent <id> is a <type>, not a requirement` | Explicit parent is a blueprint/work order/artifact. |
| `No product root: the store has no parentless requirement to attach this feature to. Pass parentRequirementId explicitly.` | Omitted parent in a store with no parentless requirement. |
| `Ambiguous product root: N parentless requirements ("…", "…"). Pass parentRequirementId explicitly.` | Omitted parent with several parentless requirements — in a survey target this means the project is not fresh. |
| `Proposal rejected — nothing was created: <message>` | Core's authoritative re-validation (typed constraint/not-found rejections, or a compensated mid-write failure). |

### `propose_root_overview` — the root documents

A fresh project is seeded with a product-root requirement (title = project
name, empty body) and a `<name> system architecture` blueprint linked
`details` → root (its body is a fill-in template). `propose_root_overview`
delivers the survey's synthesis into that pair: the product overview lands as
a **pending suggestion** on the root requirement, the system-architecture
summary as one on the blueprint — an empty-anchor insert on an empty body, a
whole-body replace over the seeded template, so accepting swaps template for
proposal. The seeded titles are untouched, and nothing is committed by the
call. One call per survey. Input:

| Field | Shape | Required | What it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `overview` | string | yes | Body proposed for the product root requirement: what the product is, who it serves, core capabilities, non-goals. Must contain a `Non-goals` heading. |
| `architecture` | string | yes | Body proposed for the root's `details` blueprint: components, data flow, stack, conventions. |
| `evidence` | `{ title, body }[]` | no — 0 to 20 | Optional overview-level evidence artifacts, `references`-linked from the root. None required: the per-feature proposals carry the mandatory evidence; the root documents are a synthesis of them. |

There is no target id — the single parentless product root and its `details`
blueprint ARE the target, resolved server-side. The root pair must be
**pristine** (untouched since seeding): the call refuses loudly when the root
body is non-empty, when the blueprint body is neither empty nor exactly the
seeded template, or when either document already has a pending suggestion —
v1 proposes only into a fresh project; an existing overview is edited in the
app, never merged over MCP.

Output shape: `{ rootRequirementId, blueprintId, artifactIds, suggestionIds }`,
where `suggestionIds` is `[overview suggestion, architecture suggestion]`.

Rejections beyond the shared blank/cap catalog above (all create nothing):

| Rejection | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `overview: no Non-goals section (missing-non-goals) — …` | The overview body has no `Non-goals` heading (any `#` level). |
| `No product root: …` / `Ambiguous product root: …` | Zero or several parentless requirements — the latter means the project is not fresh. |
| `Product root "…" has no details blueprint …` | The root lacks its seeded architecture blueprint. |
| `Ambiguous architecture target: …` | Several `details` blueprints on the root. |
| `Root overview refused: … already has a non-empty body.` | The root requirement was already written — populated project. |
| `Root overview refused: … has been edited since seeding.` | The architecture blueprint no longer holds the pristine template. |
| `Root overview refused: … has N pending suggestion(s).` | A proposal already awaits review on the root pair (anchor lock — suggestions anchor to the current body). |

## 5. Install the execution skill

The repo ships a skill that teaches a coding agent the execute-a-work-order
procedure — pick only unblocked ready orders, read the full context, restate
scope, implement, verify against the acceptance criteria, and keep status
discipline (`in_progress` on pickup, `done` only after verification, with the
completion report carried in the `done` call itself):
[`skills/kiln-execute/SKILL.md`](../skills/kiln-execute/SKILL.md).

**Claude Code** — copy it where the agent discovers skills, either per-project
or personal:

```sh
# per-project (checked into the consuming repo)
mkdir -p .claude/skills && cp -r <kiln>/skills/kiln-execute .claude/skills/

# or personal (all projects on this machine)
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills && cp -r <kiln>/skills/kiln-execute ~/.claude/skills/
```

The agent then loads it whenever it works the Kiln board (the frontmatter
`description` is the trigger).

**Cursor / other agents** — the body is plain markdown with no Claude-specific
syntax: paste it into `.cursor/rules/kiln-execute.mdc` (or your agent's
equivalent rules file), dropping the YAML frontmatter.

## 6. Headless / CI

For headless and CI contexts — no desktop app — run the same bridge from a repo
checkout as a standalone server. The tools, auth, receipts, and survey surface
are identical to the bundled endpoint above (§3–§5 apply unchanged); only the
launch differs.

### Build and seed

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm -r build

# Create (or reuse) a store and insert a demo chain:
#   artifact → requirement → blueprint → ready work order
# Prints the ready work order's id on stdout. The store resolves like every
# other entry point: KILN_DB_PATH if set, else the registry's default
# project, else ~/.kiln/kiln.db (see "Which project does the server serve?"
# below).
pnpm -C packages/mcp-server seed
```

> **Node 22.x:** the store uses the built-in `node:sqlite`, which needs the
> `--experimental-sqlite` flag. The package's `seed`/`start` scripts pass it for
> you. On Node 24+ no flag is needed.

### Start the server

```sh
KILN_MCP_TOKEN=choose-a-secret \
KILN_MCP_PORT=3777 \
pnpm -C packages/mcp-server start
```

You should see:

```
kiln-mcp-server listening on http://127.0.0.1:3777/mcp (db: /Users/you/.kiln/kiln.db)
```

Environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `KILN_DB_PATH` | — | Absolute path to a SQLite file — the ultimate override; when set, the project registry is ignored entirely. Shared with the app (WAL makes this safe). |
| `KILN_PROJECT` | — | A registered project's id, slug, or exact name. Unknown values refuse to start (never a silently-wrong store). The `--project <ref>` argv flag is the same thing, and beats an inherited env value. |
| `KILN_MCP_TOKEN` | — (required) | Bearer token clients must present. Server refuses to start without it. |
| `KILN_MCP_PORT` | `3001` | HTTP port. |
| `KILN_MCP_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address. Keep it loopback unless you know why not. |
| `KILN_MCP_ENDPOINT` | `/mcp` | HTTP path of the MCP endpoint. |

Every request without a valid `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header is refused
with `401` before it reaches any tool.

Register it with Claude Code exactly as in §2, substituting the port and token
you set:

```sh
claude mcp add --transport http kiln http://127.0.0.1:3777/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer choose-a-secret"
```

### Which project does the server serve?

Kiln supports multiple **projects** — fully isolated workspaces, one SQLite
file each, listed in `~/.kiln/projects.json` (the desktop app's switcher, the
CLI's `kiln projects` commands, and this server all read the same registry).
Every process resolves its store **once, at startup**, in this order:

1. `KILN_DB_PATH` — explicit file path, registry ignored.
2. `--project <id|slug|name>` / `KILN_PROJECT` — registry lookup; unknown
   refs are a startup error.
3. The registry's **default project** (the one the desktop app opened last).
4. No registry at all → the legacy `~/.kiln/kiln.db`.

The startup log names the resolved file — that line is how you confirm which
project a running server is bound to:

```
kiln-mcp-server listening on http://127.0.0.1:3777/mcp (db: /Users/you/.kiln/kiln.db)
```

Resolution is **per-process, never synchronized**. Switching projects in the
desktop app does NOT move a running MCP server (or CLI invocation) — an agent
mid-work-order stays on the project it started with, by design (the same
no-yank guarantee the bundled endpoint gives structurally). Two caveats that
follow from this:

- App activation *promotes* that project to the registry default, so a server
  **restarted later** without an explicit `--project`/`KILN_PROJECT` will
  follow wherever the app last was. Pin the project explicitly if the server
  must always serve the same one.
- Removing a project (app or registry) only deletes its registry entry — the
  store file always survives on disk. Never assume removal freed data.

## 7. Authoring skills (customizable house standards)

The AUTHORING agents (draft, extract, refine chat, review) — not the MCP
execution loop — can be tuned per store with **authoring skills**:
settings-managed documents whose bodies state your structure, style,
terminology, and conventions. Skills are app configuration, not knowledge:
they live in the `kiln.authoring.skills` setting as an ordered JSON array of
`{ id, title, body, enabled }` documents (array order = injection order,
`enabled` = the switch), are created/viewed/edited ONLY under **Settings →
Blueprint Writing** (which fronts `GET/PUT /settings/authoring-skills` on the
sidecar), and never appear in the knowledge graph, the navigator, Quick Open,
or export. The settings value is the single current version — skill edits
carry no revision history (a deliberate trade-off of leaving the graph;
reversed from the first delivery, which stored skills as artifact entities).

Enabled skills are injected at system-prompt strength into every draft,
extract, chat, and review call — a dedicated "Authoring skills (house
standards — follow these)" section ahead of the assembled context, resolved
once in core (`resolveAuthoringSkills`) and shared by the sidecar and CLI. A
skill may also declare a per-type template that replaces the built-in
`methodology-*` draft structure verbatim: a `## Template: requirement`,
`## Template: blueprint`, or `## Template: work-order` heading followed by the
template in a code fence (unfenced, the template runs to the next
`## Template:` heading or end of body; the first enabled skill in order
declaring a type wins). With zero enabled skills, every agent output path is
byte-identical to the built-in behavior — the house methodology and templates
are the fallback, not a casualty.

## Verified run (WO-07)

An earlier standalone-server run of this exact loop was executed against a
seeded store on 2026-07-06 with Claude Code 2.1.199 (registration + handshake)
and the MCP SDK client v1.29.0 (tool calls):

| Step | Result |
|---|---|
| `claude mcp add` + `claude mcp list` | `kiln … ✔ Connected` |
| `list_ready_work_orders` | 1 ready order: “Wire up the three MCP tools” |
| `get_work_order` | Full chain: blueprint “MCP work-order bridge”, requirement “Traceable work handoff”, artifact “Kickoff transcript” |
| `update_work_order_status → done` (from `ready`) | Rejected: must pass through `in_progress` |
| `→ in_progress`, then `→ done` | Both accepted |
| `list_ready_work_orders` | Empty — the board is clear |
| Re-open store in a fresh process | Work order status is `done` |

**This closes Phase 1: a coding agent pulled a ready work order with its full
intent chain over MCP and reported completion back to the shared store** — and
as of the bundled endpoint, the same loop runs from an app download with no
terminal at all.
